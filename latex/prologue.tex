\chapter*{Prologue}
\thispagestyle{empty}

\noindent The present volume is a collection of previously published papers on the topic of Bayesian inference. The volume is intended to be a low-threshold introduction, requiring only basic knowledge of mathematics and statistics, but also a practical guide, providing relevant background knowledge and pointers to tools for use in everyday research.\\[1ex]

\noindent Each chapter of this volume is independently published as a peer-reviewed article in a special issue of \textit{Psychonomic Bulletin and Review}, a Springer journal. The contents of these articles are reproduced here according to the terms of the license under which they were published. The content of each article is reproduced exactly, with cosmetic changes only.\\[1ex]

\noindent It's the 21st century, and excuses for failing to use Bayesian inference grow scant.  It is hoped that after reading \textit{Bayesian Inference for Psychology}, there will be none.\\[9ex]
